# PHYS 210 - INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS (FALL 2024) 
 
**Instructor:** Joss Ives (joss.ives at ubc dot ca)

**TAs:** Aiden Magor, Aaron Kraft, Karl Tsang, Katelynn Hubenig, Ksenia Khoroshun, Parmida Miri, Tomasz Lubomirski		

**Location:** 	Hebb B112

**Schedule:**  	

| | Section 101/L1A | Section 102/L1B |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lecture | Mon/Wed 12:30-13:00 | Mon/Wed 15:30-16:00 |
| Lab | Mon/Wed 13:00-14:50 | Mon/Wed 16:00-17:50 |

Please attend the sections in which you are registered. The timetable distinction between Lecture and Lab is primarily for bookkeeping as each day is taught as a contiguous 2.5-hour block.

**Pre-reqs:** One of PHYS 102, PHYS 108, PHYS 118, PHYS 158, PHYS 153, SCIE 001.

**Co-reqs:** One of MATH 152, MATH 221, MATH 223

**Office Hours:** Tues 1:00-2:00pm (Hebb 312), Tues 4:00-5:30pm (Hebb 112 and on Zoom), Thurs 11:45am-1:15pm (Zoom). This schedule will change slightly in October.

**Textbook:** There is no required textbook. Instead, preclass preparation assignments will be used for initial content delivery and your own work throughout the course will serve as your reference material. In addition to the plentiful resources available on the internet, there are two textbooks you may wish to engage with as coherent resources. The first uses a similar approach to this course: A Student’s Guide to Python for Physical Modeling by Kinder and Nelson (Second Edition). The second book is free, very good, and covers the majority of the topics we cover: [Computational Physics with Python](https://freecomputerbooks.com/Computational-Physics-with-Python-by-Eric-Ayars.html) by Eric Ayars. 

**Online Tools:**

- **UBC Jupyter Open:** Course materials will be distributed primarily through UBC Jupyter Open (https://open.jupyter.ubc.ca/). The course-specific server you may have engaged with in PHYS 119 does not provide sufficient memory for many of our PHYS 210 tasks so Jupyter Open is the default Jupyter server recommendation.for this course. 
- **Collaborative group-work on CoCalc:** A good portion of in-class time will be spent doing collaborative group-work in realtime collaborative Jupyter notebooks on CoCalc (Sagemath's online computing platform). Free accounts on this platform provide full access to what is needed for this group-work with somewhat limited computing resources. To set up an account at https://cocalc.com/ you will need to use an email address. Please see the additional note below regarding your private information and CoCalc. 
- **Canvas:** Canvas will be used for course announcements, coursework submission and distribution of materials outside of the two tools above. Importantly, all course deadlines will be communicated via assignment / quiz due dates on Canvas.
- **iClickerCloud:** In-class polling.
- **Piazza:** Online discussion forums.

**Your private information and CoCalc:** CoCalc runs on servers outside of Canada, where UBC cannot guarantee the security of your private information. Please exercise caution regarding the use of your personal information in this context. When you create your CoCalc account you may wish to use a pseudonym and/or an email not associated with your UBC student profile. Please contact UBC (LT.hub@ubc.ca) or CoCalc's support team (help@sagemath.com) if you have any questions about your privacy. 

## CLASS FORMAT

The course will be split into three modules, each of which will culminate in a project. In each module there will be an initial series of lesson days and then some in-class periods dedicated to project work. The final week of the term will be used for poster presentations where you will share the project you are the most proud of with your peers and the teaching team.

### Lesson days

The lesson-day topics are sequenced such that they build up the computational skills needed for each project. During lesson days, the class period (lecture + lab) will start with a brief interactive lecture consisting of a review of the most common challenges---shared by you---from the preclass preparation assignment and then moving into some interactive polling questions. The remainder of the class period will be dedicated to small-group activities ("group worksheets"). A small homework assignment will be provided for additional practice and will be due for completion credit before the next class period. There will often be time at the end of a class period to get started on your homework assignment. 

### Project days

Each of the three modules culminates in a small project, where you will use your computational physics skills to perform an investigation and communicate your findings. You will submit multiple revisions for each project, allowing you to iteratively improve your project as you receive feedback from peers and the teaching team.

### Poster preparation and presentation days

The second-last week of the course will be used to provide you with preparation time for your poster presentations and the final week will be used for poster presentations. Further details will be provided mid-term.

## COURSE GRADES

Your overall grade in the course will be determined based on the quality of your work in the following deliverables:

1. Project 01
2. Project 02
3. Project 03
4. Poster Presentation
5. Engagement

For each of these categories, you will receive an “editorial decision” (see Project Assessment below) such as “Publish” or “Major Revisions”. 

Your course grade will be based upon the editorial decisions you are able to achieve across all five categories. The table below provides an overview of the minimum criteria for each grade level. For a more detailed account, please see Appendix 1.

| Grade | Minimum Criteria |
| :--- | :--- |
| A (87%) | 5x Publish. Grades higher than this are obtainable only through one of more of your projects receiving distinctions |
| B (74%) | 5x Minor Revisions|
| D (50%) | 2x Minor Revisions, 3x Major Revisions |


### Project assessment

Projects in this course consist of computational physics investigations and the communication of these investigations. Project assessment resembles the process of publishing a peer-reviewed journal article. Although we will not incorporate formal peer review, you will engage in the following steps as you work toward the goal of having each of your projects earn the editorial decision of “accepted for publication”:

* **One week after the project is assigned:** Share a draft of your project for in-class feedback from your peers and the teaching team. This mirrors the process of authors asking colleagues, mentors or people with appropriate expertise to provide feedback on a draft of a journal article before finalizing it for submission.
* **Two weeks after the project is assigned (recommended):** Revise and submit your project to receive formal feedback from the teaching team. The grader (“the reviewer”) will provide detailed feedback and an editorial decision. Even the strongest projects are likely to earn an editorial decision of “accept with minor revisions” at best. This is true for professionals when trying to get a paper published as well. The majority of the time, the most positive outcome for a first submission of a journal article is that it will come back from the editor as accepted with minor revisions. Having people with relevant expertise apply this critical eye to your work is how it can go from good to great. 
* **One week after formal feedback has been received (recommended):** Revise and resubmit your project to receive a second round of formal feedback. This resubmission must include a detailed account of how the previous detailed feedback was addressed. Like when professionals revise their articles and send them back to the journals, the desired outcome is that this revised submission will be “accepted for publication”. Our goal is to return project submissions with feedback within one week of the submission deadline.
* If this project resubmission still warrants further revision, there will be opportunities to revise and resubmit yet again. 

The following table provides an overview of the editorial decisions related to project assessment, how to interpret them and how they will be indicated in the Canvas gradebook.

| Editorial decision | Description | Canvas gradebook indicator
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
| Publish (Accepted for Publication) | The project criteria have been fully addressed with no outstanding errors or issues. | 4 |
| Minor Revisions | There are minor errors or issues that need to be resolved before the project can be considered complete. These errors/issues are minor enough that the author should easily be able to determine for themselves if the feedback has been addressed sufficiently. | 3 |
| Major Revisions | There are major errors or issues requiring time and effort to address. The revised project will require further detailed feedback to determine if their revisions are sufficient. | 2 |
| Rework | The submission is poorly aligned with the criteria. A meeting with the instructor (“the editor”) is required before engaging in revisions. | 1 |
| No Submission | There has not yet been a submission. | 0 |

In many journals, outstanding manuscripts may receive a distinction, such that the editor will highlight them based on a combination of their originality, their potential impact on the field and the quality of the communication. Projects can receive a "Notable" (Level 1) distinction  for having an aspect of the work that goes significantly above and beyond expectations. Exceptional projects can receive an "Exemplary" (Level 2) distinction if the entire project goes significantly above and beyond expectations. The process for your “accepted for publication” projects to receive distinctions will be detailed further when the Project 01 details are released.

### Poster presentation assessment

The editorial decision for your poster presentation will be based on a combination of related assessments:

* The poster itself,
* Your oral presentation of the poster, and
* Your ability to answer follow-up questions related to your poster and presentation.

Further details will be provided when the Poster Presentation details are released.


### Engagement

The engagement assessment category encompasses tasks that the teaching team feel are extremely valuable for your learning in this course. The editorial decision equivalent for this assessment category is based on the percentage of the possible engagement points you have earned for your on-time submissions. . 

* Preclass preparation assignments and homework assignments are graded for completion automatically by Canvas. We will routinely spot check these submissions and may ask you to resubmit work that is insufficiently complete or thorough. Late submissions will be credited at half of the original engagement points and must be submitted by the last day of class.
* Feedback drafts of your projects may have some minimum completion criteria that require assessment from a TA to earn the relevant engagement points.
* Group worksheets will be assessed via in-class checkpoint questions from the teaching team. Each person in the group will be asked a different question and will be provided as many chances as needed to give a correct or complete answer. If you do not make it to class, you are encouraged to complete the group worksheet on your own and then debrief it during office hours to be awarded the engagement credit.  
* iClicker polling questions are not counted for engagement points.

| Editorial decision | Percentage of the possible engagement points earned |
| :--- | :--- |
| Publish (meets expectations) | 70%+ |
| Minor Revisions (approaches expectations) | 50%+ |
| Major Revisions | 0%+ |

This relatively low threshold of 70% to receive “Publish” was chosen to provide you with the opportunity to miss (no credit) or be late (half credit) on the occasional engagement task and still feel confident that you will receive the maximum possible credit in this engagement assessment category.

Please see Appendix 2 for an estimate of how the possible engagement points will be allocated.

### Missing classes

If you miss a class:

* Consult the appropriate resources on Canvas and your preferred Jupyter server. Lecture slides and any additional notes will be posted to Canvas.
* Attend office hours, which will always have the option to attend remotely via Zoom. 
* Engage with the teaching team and your peers on Piazza


### Project submission deadlines

Instead of offering extensions for projects, we offer seven project submission deadlines in the course. For the 1st, 2nd, 6th and 7th of these deadlines, you can make one initial or revised submission for any of the projects in the course. For the 3rd, 4th and 5th deadlines, you can make two initial or revised submissions. The syllabus provides recommendations for what to submit at each deadline, but it is ultimately up to you how you want to make use of these deadlines. If you miss a deadline, the submission for the next deadline will already be available so you can simply submit to that next submission deadline.

| | Oct 02 | Oct 15 | Oct 28 | Nov 12 | Nov 25 | Dec 10 | Dec 16 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Submission Deadline #  | #1  | #2  | #3  | #4  | #5  | #6  | #7  |
| Recommended submission   | Project 1   | Project 1 revision  | Project 2  | Project 2 revision  | Project 3  | Project 3 revision  | One last project revision  |
| Maximum number of different submissions accepted  | 1  | 1  | 2  | 2  | 2  | 1  | 1  |



### Academic concessions

Please reach out to Joss if you require academic concessions beyond any flexible course policies described above. Academic concessions may be granted for events falling under the categories of conflicting responsibilities, medical circumstances, or those that require compassionate grounds. Please see the UBC calendar entry on Academic Concession for further details.  Correspondence from an advisor or appropriate documentation may be required for academic concessions to be granted..


## ACADEMIC INTEGRITY AND COLLABORATION

The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is *your* work. Incidences of plagiarism or cheating may result in penalties applied to that task up to and including the task being permanently considered as not submitted. Additionally, more serious consequences may apply if the matter is deemed as needing to be referred to the Dean's office, where careful records are kept in order to monitor and prevent recurrences. A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University’s policies and procedures, may be found in theAcademic Calendar at
http://calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0.

In the broadest terms, we expect that all of your submitted or presented work represents something where you have made significant intellectual contributions and where that work ultimately reflects your understanding of the material. In the specific case of code or written work produced by or facilitated by Generative AI (GenAI), we consider you to have made a significant intellectual contribution when your interactions with the GenAI and its output required application of the skills and knowledge being developed in this course. An example of this would be extended back and forth interactions where you were assessing the generated code and refining your prompts to converge on code that worked as intended. Another example would be your own thorough and documented testing of the code generated from a GenAI prompt. 

We will never assign work to you with the intention that it should be completed by finding a resource with an already complete solution or by providing GenAI with a simple prompt. It is always better to check with us if you are unsure about your level of intellectual contribution related to something you intend to submit rather than to later find yourself engaged in academic misconduct procedures.

### Policies regarding Generative AI

In this course we seek to embrace and teach the responsible use of GenAI (Generative AI such as ChatGPT, CoPilot or Gemini). These can be extremely valuable tools in the toolkits of those engaging in computation, whether as students or practicing professionals. We will spend time in this course practicing prompting these tools, as well as testing and debugging the code they provide. However, unless otherwise stated, it is expected that you provide appropriate attribution for any code you submit that was produced by generative AI, no matter how much you subsequently modify it. 

### Additional academic integrity policies in PHYS 210

* **Attribution:** As long as you are providing attribution, it is perfectly reasonable to use SMALL chunks of code provided by a peer or internet resource. In the case of Generative AI, you may use and provide attribution for larger chunks of code as long as you are adhering to the expectation that you made significant intellectual contributions as outlined previously.
* **Formal group work:** You are encouraged to talk to each other, to the teaching team, and to learn from any and all resources at your disposal. For in-class group activities, we expect you to participate fully in your group's collaborative activities and it is your responsibility to ensure you understand your group's work fully. 
* **Individual work:** It is not acceptable to gather with a friend or two to work through a project to produce a common version nor is it acceptable to submit a modified version of somebody else's work as your own.

## CANADIAN CONSORTIUM OF SCIENCE EQUITY SCHOLARS (CCSES) EQUITY PROJECT SURVEYS

Near the start and end of the term you will be invited to participate in surveys administered by the research team from the Canadian Consortium of Science Equity Scholars (CCSES). This study is external to the course, and your participation is entirely optional. As an incentive to participate in this study, participating students will be awarded 4 bonus engagement points for the the start of term survey and 4 additional bonus engagement points for the end of term survey. 

These surveys are part of a cross-Canada research project studying university science courses with the aim of identifying features that make STEM courses inclusive and equitable. The questions in these surveys explore students' perceptions of classroom climate, sense of belonging, and course outcomes. The CCSES analyzes these data to develop an understanding of students' social and academic identities, along with their experiences in first-year STEM classrooms. This will help science educators better understand and respond to the diverse needs of their students, especially those currently or historically underrepresented in STEM. This project aims to foster change that enables instructors to create more equitable classroom environments in postsecondary settings, ensuring that all students who wish to pursue STEM can succeed. If you have any questions, please contact the research team at ccses@science.ubc.ca.

**Disclosure:** Dr. Ives is a member of the project study team. However, the only information that will be available to him during the term is the list of participants for the purposes of applying this bonus. After the term, he will only gain access to a version of the survey data with personally identifying information removed. 

## UNIVERSITY SUPPORT AND RESOURCES

UBC provides resources to support student learning and to maintain healthy lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise and so there are additional resources to access including those for survivors of sexual violence. UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all members of the academic community. Harassment and discrimination are not tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom. UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and for religious and cultural observances. UBC values academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their actions. Details of the policies and how to access support are available: https://senate.ubc.ca/policies-resources-support-student-success


## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
