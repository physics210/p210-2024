    "Monte Carlo error propagation starts with the notion that one representation of a measurement uncertainty (aka measurement error) is that of a gaussian where the mean of the gaussian represents the measurand (the value) and the standard deviation represents the measurement error. \n",

    "* $I=(0.0642 \\pm 0.0029)\\mbox{ A}$.\n",
