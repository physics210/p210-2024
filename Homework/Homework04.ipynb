    "## *4.3 Fourth root estimate: Newton's Method*\n",
    "You may have seen Newton's Method [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_method) in a calculus class as a way to find roots of an equation. As a quick review, the method is illustrated in the figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/homework04-newtwon-method.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The way it works is that you pick a starting point on the x-axis and call it $x_0$, (1.25 in the example above). You then evaluate the function, $f(x_0)$, and its derivative, $f'(x_0)$, at that point. Then using the derivative, slide down the tangent line (in blue) until you get back to the x axis. Call that point $x_1$. Then you can repeat the procedure, getting closer and closer to the root, which is where the equation passes through 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method can be expressed as:\n",
    "$$ x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Subject to certain conditions on the function $f(x)$ and its first derivative (that we will not worry about), if $x_0$ is close enough to one of the roots, the sequence will converge to that nearest root.\n",
    "Because the function may have more than one root, which root is arrived at depends on the initial guess, $x_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program, using a `while` or `for` loop, that finds the root of the funtion $f(x) = x^4-1$ by iterating Newton's method from the starting point `x0`. The output of this program should be two integer values:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `n`: This is the number of iterations of Newton's method that was required for convergence. Here we define convergence as when the distance between $x_n$ and one of the roots (`-1` or `1`) is less than 0.02. If the starting value, `x0`, is already within 0.02 of a root, the number of iterations required is 0. If it takes two iterations ($x_1$ and $x_2$), then this should be `n = 2`.\n",
    "* `root`: This is the value of the root that was converged to, `-1` or `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Failure to converge:** Your loop should perform a maximum of 100 iterations. If it gets to a 100th iteration and then does not converge during that iteration, the values above should be `n = 100`, `root = -99`. Otherwise, if it does converge during the 100th iteration, the values should be `n = 100` and then `root = -1` or `root = 1`, as appropriate.\n",
