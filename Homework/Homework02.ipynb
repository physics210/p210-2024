    "\n",
    "To do this:\n",
    "1. **Restart & Run All:** From the \"Kernel\" menu to the right of the \"Cell\" menu, select \"Restart & Run All\". This will restart the python Kernel, erasing all variables currently stored in memory so that when you \"Run All\" cells, you can ensure that if you were to run your notebook again on a later day, it would run as intended.\n",
    "1. Look through the whole notebook and make sure there are no errors. Many questions have purposeful errors in the distributed version so make sure you have fixed them all such that \"Restart & Run All\" will run through the whole book and successfully print \"The notebook ran without errors\" at the end. If you have any trouble resolving the errors, please ask one of your classmates or ask us in class or on Piazza.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Export notebook as HTML:** After you've executed and checked your notebook, choose: `File => Save_and_Export_Notebook_As => HTML`. This will download an HTML version of your notebook to your computer. This version is can not be executed or modified. You may need to disable any pop-up blockers to allow the file to be downloaded.\n",
