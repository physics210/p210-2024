    "Today's reading expands on the concept of Python containers. A container is any object that holds an arbitrary number of other objects. Generally, containers provide a way to access the contained objects and to iterate over them. Different containers store data differently and provide different ways to access their data. Some containers are more convenient than others for specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of what we discuss in this section will review concepts we have already discussed and others will be new to this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common python container types (not including those additional ones available via Numpy):\n",
    "\n",
    "* **list** – The most popular container data type in python; can store any number of any objects.\n",
    "* **tuple** – Similar to a list, yet once created are immutable (i.e., cannot be further changed).\n",
    "* **set** – Can store only unique elements – we won’t really look at these.\n",
    "* **dictionary** – Also known as associative arrays. They contain mapping of keys into values.\n",
    "* **str** – String, a sequence of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Containers in Python can be either **mutable** or **immutable**. Mutable means it can be changed, immutable objects cannot be changed once created. The fact that a container object is immutable doesn’t always mean that the objects it holds are also immutable (e.g., an immutable tuple holding mutable lists).\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of *mutable containers* include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* list, set, dictionary,\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of *immutable containers* include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* string, tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Container objects can store their content in either an ordered or unordered manner. Orderedness is unrelated to the mutability of objects. This means that both mutable and immutable objects can be either ordered or unordered.\n",

    "* list, string, tuple\n",

    "\n",
    "From the list above, the new containers we will spend some time with are **tuples** and **dictionaries**. You already have familiarity with strings and lists. Note that we have also encountered numpy arrays, but these are containers that require the numpy library so are not discussed as standard python containers heres."
