    "\n",
    "One of the most fundamental concepts in programming is that of functions. You use functions all the time, e.g. `np.sqrt()` is the square-root function. In python, the syntax to *call a function* looks like:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = my_function(arguments)\n",
    "```\n",
    "where `result` is the outcome of your new function given some input `arguments`. The parentheses are an important part of this – they are what actually indicates that you intend this to be a function call. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the **syntax to define a function** is:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_function(param1, param2):\n",
    "# parameters are optional, the \"(\", \")\" and \":\" are mandatory\n",
    "    calculations that use parameters\n",
    "    return value # optional\n",
    "```\n",
    "The words argument and parameter are often used interchangeably. To be precise, parameters are defined within the function. Arguments are passed in when the function is called and become the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The python keyword `def` defines a new function. Today you will learn how to create both “fruitful” functions (i.e. functions which return a result), and void functions (i.e. functions which return no result). \n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Frutiful functions:** Fruitful functions return a value. You can assign the result of a fruitful function to a variable\n",
    "2. **Void function:** Void functions do not return a *meaningful* value. Instead of returning a result that you might wish to assign to a variable, they instead perform an action, such as printing something or modifying an object (such as a list)  \"in place\", as we discussed previously. Technically, a void function returns a `None` value, which we will also explore."

Within these `euler_x()` functions, these five variables were given different names (see below) to help us distinguish the global variables outside of `euler_x()` from the local variables within `euler_x()`.\n",

Instead, the global variables that were previously passed in as arguments (`y0`, `v0`, `t0`, `tmax` and `dt`) are instead just used directly within this function. The comments included in these code blocks highlight the changes needed to remove the need for parameters."

    "Why would we use `euler_lists()` and `euler_arrays()` with parameters instead of these versions (`euler2_lists()` and `euler2_arrays()`), which don't need parameters? One of the main reasons is that a function that relies only on information passed to it via arguments is much more reusable. You can copy it into any notebook and use it as intended by ensuring you know which arguments to send to it. Conversely, if you hard-code the variables that the function needs access to outside of itself, that means you have to make sure that those variables have those exact names in your code outside of the function or that you will be needing to rename those variables within the function to use the code in some new situation. This is much less flexible. "
