Because the iterable object is a string, the `for c` part tells Python to create a variable `c`, which will be a `str type`, and which will hold each letter of `somestuff` one at a time, in sequence. Note that the variable `c` could have any name, but here we called it `c` to help remind us that it is used to store a character."
