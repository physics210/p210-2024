    "1. Identify the rank, number of rows, number of columns and length for a given numpy array.\n",
    "1. Identify the attributes ndim, shape, size and dtype for a given numpy array.\n",
    "1. Predict the output from combining two numerical numpy arrays of the same shape using the common arithmetic operations `+`, `-`, `/`, and `*`.\n",
    "1. Define (create) an array with one or more dimensions and fill it with values provided via a list (e.g., `numpy.array([1, 2, 3])`).\n",
    "1. Use an intrinsic array creation function to define an array and fill it with zeros or ones (e.g., `numpy.zeros(3)`).\n",
    "1. Specify data type when creating a numpy array (e.g., `np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=float)`).\n",
    "1. Index or slice a numpy array having one or more dimensions. \n",
    "1. Use array methods such as `sum()`, `max()` and `std()` to perform operations on arrays\n",
    "1. Predict the impact of changing an element in an array after a shallow copy or deep copy of the array has been made"
