    "1. You need to know how to terminate an infinite loop, but unfortunately with the web-based Jupyter servers, they often respond quite slowly. First, try to click on `Kernel` above and then `Interrupt`. The longer you let your infinite loop run, the longer this may take to respond. If it takes more than 10s of seconds, you can try to instead `Shutdown` the kernel. If you are not getting any response from either of these approaches, try going to `File >> Hub Control Panel` and then clicking on `Stop My Server`, closing your old Jupyter Open tab, and then clicking on `Start my Server`. Once you initiate the initial `Interrupt`, you may just need to wait until that tab on your browser crashes and then reload it. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. Does the \"I really wasn't expecting this result\" ever print?\n",
    "1. What happens if you add four spaces in front of the 'print(\"Loop finished\")' statement?\n",
    "1. What happens if you comment out or delete the x = x + dx line?\n",
    "1. What happens if we define `xmax` as a value smaller than our initial value of `x=0.`?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note that this program is a very un-python way of doing this sort of calculation and is really the kind of construction is the kind of approach used in older programming languages like C or Fortran. A much more pythonesque way of doing this would be to make x an array and do all the calculations at once, which is something we will learn in a lesson in the near future.*"
