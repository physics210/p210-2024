As you have seen when you ran the single-particle code above multiple times, some particles will wander off far in the positive or negative directions and others will remain somewhat close to x = 0. You will not be surprised to learn that if we look at this behaviour for multiple particles at once, we will expect the positions of all particles at a specific time to follow a Gaussian distribution. Further to that, we can also expect that the standard deviation of this Gaussian distribution should evolve like the square root of the number of steps taken.\n",
